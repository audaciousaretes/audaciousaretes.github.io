# Smarter Todos

The tiny javascript framework we created last assignment was great for just adding todo list items, but what happens when we want to check the status of an item or update an item to complete?

We need to do two things:

- Create a todo list constructor
    - private list
    - add todo method
    - get todo list length
    - show todos
- Create a todo constructor
    - public description
    - private status
    - get status method
    - set status to "complete" method
    - set status to "deferred" method

Deliverable:

- Working console todo list, where I can't break things like your todo list or a todo's status
- I should be able to add to, list and see the length of your to todolist
- I should be able to see a list of object methods on your todo item
